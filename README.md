# Background
***
In DC, over half the commercial rental buildings are rent-stabilized, where rent cannot be raised beyond certain limits. Two particularly important policies are the usual amount that rent can be raised when a unit turns over (currently 10%), and the cap on the amount that rent can be raised to match another similar unit in the building (currently 30%).
